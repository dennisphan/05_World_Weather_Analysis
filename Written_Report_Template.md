# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project
PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
### Purpose
Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

The analysis includes three parts:
 - Collect the Data
    + City, country, and date
    + Latitude and longitude
    + Maximum temperature
    + Humidity
    + Cloudiness
    + Wind speed
 - Exploratory Analysis with Visualization
    + Create scatter plots of the weather data for the following comparisons:
        > Latitude versus temperature
        > Latitude versus humidity
        > Latitude versus cloudiness
        > Latitude versus wind speed
    + Determine the correlations for the following weather data:
        > Latitude and temperature
        > Latitude and humidity
        > Latitude and cloudiness
        > Latitude and wind speed
    + Create a series of heatmaps using the Google Maps and Places API that showcases the following:
        > Latitude and temperature
        > Latitude and humidity
        > Latitude and cloudiness
        > Latitude and wind speed
 - Visualize Travel Data
    + Create a heatmap with pop-up markers that can display information on specific cities based on a customer's travel preferences.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
